Abstract
It is known that e-commerce refers to the purchase and sale of goods and/or services via the Internet. Online Food Ordering System is a part of e-commerce. ONLINE FOOD ORDER SYSTEM is a website designed primarily for use in the food delivery industry. Through these services, restaurants can sell and distribute their resources at minimal resource usage effectively with high profits by gaining customer trust. This Online food order system database will be helpful for the business owners to extend their business just by placing the orders online and not visiting the restaurant. There is no confinement for placing and receiving the orders since the order can be placed online. There will be no waiting time with the vast amount of verities at comfortable prices. To develop this application database is the main part that will communicate through the application to retrieve the details. We will be creating the Online food ordering database with MySQL as a platform. The database includes Customers who can place their orders from different food categories and restaurant staff will process the orders and deliver the requested order with an expected delivery time, and asking the customers for the reviews and depending on the order quantity providing the rewards to the customers where they can claim the money.


CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION

    It is very typical to establish a small-scale business with fewer resources to provide quality services. Nowadays people are attracted to online business. Let us assume if there is an online business where customers can order their needs and the goods will reach them at the expected delivery time. The customers of today are not only attracted because placing an order online is very convenient but also because they have visibility into the items offered, likewise, online food ordering system customers can order their favorite foods and this database will be the barrier for the customers and restaurants to provide the services. Our solution provides an ordering process for the restaurants and customers and employees of the restaurants. The Items list and categories of the foods are available in the database so that a customer can place an order with multiple items. Once the order is placed restaurant employees process the order and deliver it to the customer at the expected delivery time. at the end of the order, the customer will know about the amount how much he had to pay for the restaurant for the order. Once the order is delivered the customer can provide feedback to the restaurant.


1.1	PROJECT AIMS AND OBJECTIVES

The aim is to automate its existing manual system with the help of computerized equipment and full-fledged computer software, fulfilling their requirements so that their valuable data /information can be stored for a longer period with easy access and manipulation of the same. The project describes how to manage for good performance and better services for the clients.

The project’s main objective is to learn and implement a real-time application on a database for Online-Food Ordering System. The project concentrates on taking orders, streamlining the orders to a specified restaurant and billing. This Database will be a great solution for many start-up food businesses, they can just start initially with fewer funds by posting their menu online with this application.


1.2	BACKGROUND OF THE PROJECT

The online food ordering system is one of the latest servicers most fast-food restaurants in the western world are adopting. With this method, food is ordered online and delivered to the customer. This is made possible through the use of an electronic payment system. Customers pay with their credit cards, although credit card customers can be served even before they make payment either through cash or card. So, the system designed in this project will enable customers to go online and place an order for their food. Due to the great increase in the awareness of the internet and the technologies associated with it, several opportunities are coming up on the web. So many businesses and companies now venture into their business with ease because of the internet. One of such businesses that the internet introduced is an online food ordering system. In today’s age of fast food and take out, many restaurants have chosen to focus on quick preparation and speedy delivery of orders rather than offering a rich dining experience. Until recently, most of these delivery orders were placed over the phone, but there are many disadvantages to this system. Anybody can order any goods via the internet and have the goods delivered at his/her doorsteps. But while trying to discuss the transfer method of the goods and services, attention is focused on the payment mode. In other words, how possible is it to pay for goods and services via the internet? This then leads to the discussion of the economic consequences of digital cash. What are the implementations from the viewpoint of economics? Since the world is fast becoming a global village, the necessary tool for this process is the communication of which telecommunication is a key player. A breakthrough is the wireless 2 telephone system which comes in either fixed wireless telephone lines or the Global System of Mobile communication (GSM). What I propose is an online ordering system originally designed for use in college cafeterias, but just as applicable in any food delivery industry. The main advantage of this system is that it greatly simplifies the ordering process for both the customer and the restaurant. The system also greatly lightens the load on the restaurant's end, as the entire process of taking orders is automated. Once an order is placed on the webpage that will be designed, it is placed into the database and then retrieved, in pretty much real-time, by a desktop application on the restaurant's end. Within this application, all items in the order are displayed, along with their corresponding options and delivery details, in a concise and easy to read manner. This allows the restaurant employees to quickly go through the orders as they are placed and produce the necessary items with minimal delay and confusion. The greatest advantage of this system is its FLEXIBILITY.




1.3	SCOPE OF THE PROJECT



The online ordering system will be a web-based application whose main language of programming will be PHP. Its main aim is to simplify and improve the efficiency of the ordering process for both customer and restaurant, minimize manual data entry and ensure data accuracy and security during the order placement process. Customers will also be able to view product menus and their ingredients and be able to have a visual confirmation that the order was placed correctly. It may help collect perfect management in detail. In a very short time, the collection will be obvious, simple and sensible. It will help a person to know the management of passed year perfectly and vividly. It also helps in current all works relative to Online. Food Ordering System. It will be also reduced the cost of collecting the management & collection procedure will go on smoothly. Our project aims at Business process automation, i.e. we have tried to computerize various processes of the Online Food Ordering System.

•	In a computer system, the person has to fill the various forms & number of copies of the forms can be easily generated at a time.
•	In a computer system, it is not necessary to create the manifest but we can directly print it, which saves our time.
•	To assist the staff in capturing the effort spent on their respective working areas.
•	To utilize resources efficiently by increasing their productivity through automation.
•	The system generates types of information that can be used for various purposes.
•	It satisfies the user requirement.
•	Be easy to understand by the user and operator
•	Be easy to operate.
•	Have a good user interface.
•	Be expandable.
Delivered on schedule within the budget
